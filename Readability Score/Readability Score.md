## Readability Score Program

This program assess how "readable" a piece of text is. It works on .txt files. There are 4 scoring indexes used in the Readability Assessement; 
* Flesch-Kincaid Readability Test
* SMOG Index
* Coleman-Liau Index
* Automated Readability Index

## How To Use the Indexes
The program will prompt you to choose which test you want to evaluate the text. The options will be `(ARI, FK, SMOG, CL, all)`. An appropriate error message will be displayed if the option entered was not on the list.
