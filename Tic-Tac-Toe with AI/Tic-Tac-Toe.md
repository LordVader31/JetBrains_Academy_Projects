## Tic-Tac-Toe with AI

This package contains a working model of a Tic-Tac-Toe game engine. The human player gets to decide whether they want a 
* Human vs. Human 
* Human vs. Engine
* Engine vs. Engine

There 3 levels of Engines :
* Easy - which plays random moves
* Medium - which plays sensibly (i.e it blocks opponent's winning moves and attempts to find a winning combination)
* Hard - which plays perfectly (according to the [minimax algorithm](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-make-your-tic-tac-toe-game-unbeatable-by-using-the-minimax-algorithm-9d690bad4b37/))

The Hard Engine is **unbeatable** (i.e you can only draw and lose against it). It will always play perfectly. To clarify, only the name of the project says AI, there is **no ML / Reinforcement Learning models built in.**
